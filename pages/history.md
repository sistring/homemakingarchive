## Building the Jewish Community in Kansas

This exhibit explores the community building efforts of Jewish Kansans from the early 1900s to the present day. By identifying employment opportunities and developing Kosher foodways, Jewish Kansans have fostered relationships of mutual aid for their local communities. Various social organizations have formed out of efforts to create safe places for Jewish cultural expression in rural Kansas.

## Moving to the Midwest

Jewish immigration to Kansas began as early as the 1850s when the first Jewish cemeteries appeared on the Kansas landscape, followed by congregations and social organizations. Some Jewish immigrants came to Kansas after being pushed away from other locations due to antisemitism, lack of community support, and lack of access to resources. Other Jewish people came to Kansas to follow education and employment opportunities.

## Yiddish Map of the U.S.
First-generation refugees are often forced to navigate foreign spaces in unfamiliar languages. Nearly all of the two-million Jewish people who immigrated from Eastern Europe between 1880 and 1924 spoke Yiddish. This map from the Industrial Removal Office provides essential information about U.S. states and cities for new Americans making their way across the country.

## IRO Agreement Form
In 1901, the the Industrial Removal Office (IRO) was created with the purpose of placing Jewish immigrants in Midwestern towns. Many American-born Jews believed that the density of the Eastern European Jewish population in East Coast cities was causing a rise in antisemitism. One response was to disperse Jews to the heartland.
